Description: The lutz package has the sf package in Suggests, and only uses sf
    functions conditionally when using the "acccurate" method, and checks that 
    sf is installed first. Because sf is in Suggests, it does not get installed
    automatically when lutz is installed, which makes it tricky for a pacakge 
    that depends on lutz to use the functionality which depends on sf 
    (tz_lookup(..., method = "accurate")). The approach here is to include sf in 
    Imports so that sf is installed automatically in the reverse dependency that
    requires it. The issue is that because sf functions are not called directly 
    by the reverse dependency, R CMD check complains about unused imports. The 
    solution is to include a call to any sf function in a "stub" function that
    is never actually used in the package. This function is called ignore_unused_imports().
